# TODO and ideas
- [] implement /stats page
- [] make pwa installable (probably need more icons or some manifest values)
- [] download all item images from fandom
- [] find a nice way to show item count without taking space (or maybe even consider not showing it)
- [] animate item button to 'pop' when pressed
- [] change currentFarm to be a query instead of a state (is it better tho?)
