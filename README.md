# TODO and ideas
- [ ] make pwa installable (probably need more icons or some manifest values)
- [ ] support light mode
- [ ] let the user edit his farms
- [ ] export farm as JSON

## How to run
to build and serve
```
npm run build
serve dist/
```
to run a local development server
`npm run dev`

## how to use
1. create your farm in the farms tab (/farms)
2. track items in the track tab (/track)
3. see your statistics in the stats tab (/stats)
